# MERN Stack

In this Project, I created a simple To-do app using Javascript and deployed it to a MERN webstack. The frontend was done with ReactJS, the backend with ExpressJS, the database was set up using MongoDB (unstructured database) and Node.js was used to setup the runtime environment for displaying results to the end user.
